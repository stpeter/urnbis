    <section title='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
      <t>A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) <xref target='RFC3986'/> that is assigned under the "urn" URI scheme and a particular URN namespace, with the intent that the URN
		 will be a persistent, location-independent resource identifier.
		 A URN namespace is a collection of such URNs, each of which is (1) unique, (2) assigned in a consistent and managed way, and (3) assigned according to a common definition.  (Some URN namespaces create names that exist only as URNs, whereas others assign URNs based on names that were already created in non-URN identifier systems,
		 such as ISBNs <xref target='RFC3187'/>, ISSNs <xref target='RFC3044'/>, or
		 RFCs <xref target="RFC2648"/>.)</t>
	  <!-- JcK 20161224: Didn't seem wise to use exclusively TC 46 specs as examples -->
      <t>The assignment of URNs is done by an organization (or, in some cases, according to an algorithm or other automated process) that has been formally delegated a URN namespace within the "urn" scheme (e.g., a URN in the 'example' URN namespace <xref target='RFC6963'/> might be of the form "urn:example:foo").</t>
      <t>This document rests on two key assumptions:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Assignment of a URN is a managed process.</t>
          <t>The space of URN namespaces is itself managed.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>While other URI schemes may allow resource identifiers to be freely chosen and assigned, such is not the case for URNs.  The syntactical correctness of a name starting with "urn:" is not sufficient to make it a URN.  In order for the name to be a valid URN, the namespace identifier (NID) needs to be registered in accordance with the rules defined here and the remaining parts of the assigned-name portion of the URN need to be generated in accordance with the rules for the registered URN namespace.</t>
      <t>So that information about both URN syntax and URN namespaces is available in one place, this document does the following:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Defines the canonical syntax for URNs in general (in a way that is consistent with URI syntax), specifies methods for determining URN-equivalence, and discusses URI conformance.</t>
          <t>Specifies a method for defining a URN namespace and associating it with a namespace identifier (NID),
			 and describes procedures for registering URN NIDs with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>For URN syntax and URN namespaces, this document modernizes and replaces
		 the original specifications for URN syntax <xref target='RFC2141'/>
		 and for the definition and registration of URN namespaces <xref target='RFC3406'/>.
		 These modifications build on the key requirements provided
		 in the original functional description for URNs <xref target='RFC1737'/> and
		 on the lessons of many years of experience.
		 In those original documents and in the present one, the
		 intent is to define URNs in a consistent manner so that,
		 wherever practical, the parsing, handling, and resolution of
		 URNs can be independent of the URN namespace within which a
		 given URN is assigned. </t>
	  <t>Together with input from several key user
		 communities, the history and experiences with URNs dictated expansion of the URN definition
		 to support new functionality, including the use of syntax explicitly reserved
		 for future standardization in RFC 2141.  All URN namespaces and URNs that were
		 valid under the earlier specifications remain valid even though it may be
		 useful to update some of them to take advantage of new features. </t>
	  <t>
          <cref> JcK 20161226: Proposed additional paragraph to try to immunize
		 ourselves against never-ending terminology
		 quibbles:</cref>
          The foregoing considerations, together with various differences between URNs and locator-type URIs
		 (specifically URLs) as well as the greater
		 focus on URLs in RFC 3986 
                 as the ultimate successor to <xref target='RFC1738'/> and <xref target='RFC1808'/>,
		 <vspace blankLines="0"/><cref>JcK 20161227: That assertion is justified by
			the first few of paragraphs of Section 1 of RFC 3986, which first
			describes its derivation from RFC 1630, which is clearly
			about what this document calls "locators".  Then, although
			it says "designed to meet the ... Uniform Resource Names",
			it goes on to say 'This document obsoletes [RFC2396],
			which merged "Uniform Resource Locators" [RFC1738] and
			"Relative Uniform Resource Locators" [RFC1808] in order
			to define a single, generic syntax for all URIs.', i.e.,
			that it is merging two URL documents and calling the
			results URIs.  I hope that level of detail does not need
			to be in 2141bis </cref><vspace blankLines="0"/>
			may lead to some interpretations
		 of RFC 3986 and this specification that appear (or perhaps
		 actually are) not completely consistent, especially with
		 regard to actions or semantics other than the basic syntax
		 itself.
		 If such situations arise, discussions of URNs and URN
		 namespaces should be interpreted according to this document
		 and not by extrapolation from RFC 3986.</t>
	  <t>Summaries of changes from RFC 2141 and RFC 3406 appear in
		 <xref target='changes-2141'/> and <xref target='changes-3406'/>
		 respectively.  This document obsoletes both
		 <xref target='RFC2141'/> and <xref target='RFC3406'/>.
	     While it does not explicitly update or replace <xref target="RFC1737"/>
		 or <xref target="RFC2276"/>, the reader who references those
		 documents should be aware that the conceptual model of URNs
		 in this document is slightly different from those older
		 specifications. </t>

    <section title="Terminology" anchor="terms">
      <t>The following terms are distinguished from each other as described below:
	    <vspace blankLines="0"/><cref>JcK 20161223 (retained for -19f
		   only -- remove if we think we've fixed it; rewrite
		   otherwise): The entries below are problematic.
		   If a "name" is a member
		   of a namespace, then an NID can't be a name and the "name" is bound to the
		   NSS.  NID-as-name, despite what appears below, is common usage.
		   The definition of "URN" given below is consistent
		   with that, but inconsistent with the terminology of 3986 which claims that
	       a "URI" is the whole string that gets parsed into components and suggests
	       that a "foo URI" is a URI with scheme "foo", such that a "URN [URI]" is
		   the whole string, probably including q-components and f-components if they
	       appear.  Note also multiple uses of "URN" in Section 1.2.1 and elsewhere: one
		   is not resolving the URN _name_, one is resolving either the "Assigned-name"
		   or the whole string.   In Section 2.3.2 (and similarly elsewhere), the
		   q-component is described at continuing "to the end of the URN" -- clearly
		   assuming it is not only not a name but that it includes the q-component,
		   f-component, etc.</cref> <vspace blankLines="0"/>
		   <cref>JcK 20161225 Recommendation: Say "name" is ambiguous wrt URNs due to multiple
	       conflicting uses and discourage its use.  Define URN as the entire string,
	       including the "urn:" scheme identifier.  That makes "Assigned-name" a
		   subset of "URN" when foo-components are present and we should say that and
		   then move on (as defined in -19d and earlier, it is a superset of "URN").</cref>

      </t>
	  <t> The term "name" is deliberately not defined here and should

		 such as translating the persistent URN into one or more
		 current locators for the resource, delivering metadata about
		 the resource in an appropriate format,
		 or even delivering a representation of the resource (e.g., a document)

		 At the time of this writing, resolution services are

	<section title="Design Tradeoffs" anchor="tradeoffs">
	   <t>To a degree much greater than when URNs were first
		  considered and their uses outlined
		  (see <xref target="RFC1737"/>), issues of persistent
		  identifiers on the Internet involve fundamental design
		  tradeoffs that are much broader than URNs or the URN approach, 
                  and even touch on open research questions
                  within the information sciences community.  Ideal and comprehensive
		  specifications about what should be done or required across
		  the entire universe of URNs would require general agreement about,
		  and solutions to, a wide range of such issues.  
                  Although some of those issues were
		  introduced by the Internet or computer-age approaches to
		  character encodings and data abstraction, others predate the
		  Internet and computer systems by centuries; there is
		  unlikely to be agreement about comprehensive
		  solutions in the near future.</t>
          <t>Although this specification 
                  consequently contains some requirements
		  and flexibility that would not be present in a more perfect
		  world, this has been necessary in order to produce a
		  consensus specification that provides a modernized definition
                  of URNs (the unattractive alternative would have been to not
                  modernize the definition in spite of widespread deployment).</t>
          <t>The following sub-sections describe two of the relevant issues in greater detail.</t>
	        <!-- JcK 20160126 (former CREF1): We know what those
				  are and can list them (the
				  change log for -15 contains a hint or two).  I would rather
				  not, but this is ultimately up to the WG.  -->
	  <section title="Resolution" anchor="tradeoffs-resolution">
	   <t>One issue that is specific to URNs (as opposed to naming systems in general)
		  is the fairly difficult topic of "resolution",
		  discussed in <xref target="terms"/>,
		  <xref target='syntax-r'/>, <xref target='definition-resolution'/>, and
		  elsewhere below.
           </t>
           <t>With traditional Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), 
                  i.e. with most URI schemes for locators, 
                  resolution is relatively straightforward 
                  because it is used to determine an access mechanism
                  which in turn is used to dereference the locator by (typically)
                  retrieving a representation of the associated resource,
                  such as a document
                  (see Section 1.2.2 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>).
           </t>
           <t>By contrast, resolution for URNs is more flexible and varied.
           </t>
           <t>One important case involves the mapping of a URN to one
                  or more locators.  In this case, the end result is
                  still a matter of dereferencing the mapped locator(s)
                  to one or more representations.  The primary difference
                  here is persistence: even if a mapped locator has changed 
                  (e.g., a DNS domain name has changed hands and a URL has 
                  not been modified to point to a new location or, in a more
				  extreme and hypothetical case, the DNS is replaced
				  entirely), a URN user
                  will be able to obtain the correct representation (e.g., 
                  a document) as long as the resolver has kept its URN-to-locator
                  mappings up to date.  Consequently, the relevant
		  relationships can be defined quite precisely for URNs that 
                  resolve to locators which in turn are dereferenced to a
                  representation. 
            </t>
            <t>However, this specification permits several other cases of 
                  URN resolution as well as URNs for resources that do not
                  involve information retrieval systems.  This is true either 
                  individually for particular URNs 
                  or (as defined below) collectively for entire URN namespaces.
            </t>
            <t>Consider a namespace of URNs that resolve to locators 
                  which in turn are dereferenced only to 
                  metadata about resources because the underlying systems contain
                  no representations of those resources;
                  an example might be a URN namespace for International Standard Name 
                  Identifiers (ISNI) as that identifier system is defined in
                  <xref target='ISO.27729.2012'/>, wherein by default a URN would be 
                  resolved only to a metadata record describing 
                  the individual identified by the ISNI.
            </t>
            <t>Consider also URNs that resolve to representations only if the
                  requesting entity is authorized to obtain the representation,
                  whereas other entities can obtain only metadata about the
                  resource; an example might be documents held within the legal
                  depository collection of a national library.
            </t>
            <t>Finally, some URNs might not be intended to resolve
                  to locators at all; examples might include URNs identifying 
                  XML namespace names (e.g., the 'dgiwg' URN namespace 
                  specified by <xref target='RFC6288'/>), URNs identifying application 
                  features that can be supported within a communications protocol (e.g.,
                  the 'alert' URN namespace specified by <xref target='RFC7462'/>),
                  and URNs identifying enumerated types such as values in a registry
                  (e.g., a URN namespace could be used to individually identify the 
                  values in all IANA registries, as provisionally proposed in
                  <xref target='I-D.saintandre-iana-urn'/>).
            </t>
            <t> <!-- These types of URNs and the resolution services available for them
                  leave the concept of "resolution"
		  somewhat more difficult for URNs than the straightforward case of
		  resolution to a locator that is dereferenced to a
			   representation.  (Per Juha, 20161223 7:24 AM +0000) -->
			   Various types of URNs and multiple resolution services
			   which may be available for them leave the concept of
			   "resolution" more complicated but also much richer
			   for URNs than the straightforward case of resolution

	   <t>A similar set of considations apply to character sets and encodings.
		  URNs, especially URNs that will be used as user-facing

		  among those goals and it is impossible at present to see how a simple
		  and readily-understandable set of rules could be developed that
		  would be optimal, or even reasonable, for all URNs.  The

		   equivalent).</t>

		        imposed by RFC 3986." per message from Sean 20160221  -->
		<t>Characters outside the ASCII range <xref target='RFC20'/>
		   are not permitted in NIDs, and no encoding mechanism for such characters is supported.</t>
		<t><xref target='ns-formal'/> and
		   <xref target='ns-informal'/> impose additional constraints
		   on the strings that can be used as NIDs, i.e., the syntax
		   shown above is not comprehensive.</t> 
      </section>

      <section title='Namespace Specific String (NSS)' anchor='syntax-nss'>
        <t>The namespace specific string (NSS) is a string, unique
		   within a URN namespace, that is assigned and managed in a consistent way and that conforms to the definition of the relevant URN namespace.  The combination of the NID (unique across the entire "urn" scheme) and the NSS (unique within the URN namespace) ensures that the resulting URN is globally unique.</t>
        <t>The NSS as specified in this document allows several characters not
		   permitted by earlier specifications
		   (see <xref target='changes-2141'/>). In particular, the "/"
		   character, which is now allowed, effectively makes it possible
		   to encapsulate hierarchical names from non-URN identifier systems.  For instance, consider the hypothetical example of a hierarchical identifier system in which the names take the
		   form of a sequence of numbers separated by the "/" character, such as "1/406/47452/2".  If the authority for such names were to use URNs, it would be natural to place the existing name in the NSS, resulting in URNs such as "urn:example:1/406/47452/2".</t>
        <t>Those changes to the syntax for the NSS do not modify the encoding rules for URN namespaces that were defined in accordance with <xref target='RFC2141'/>.  If any such URN namespace whose names are used outside of the URN context
		   (i.e., in a non-URN identifier system)
		   also allows the use of "/", "~", or "&amp;" in the native
		   form within that identifier system, then the encoding rules
		   for that URN namespace are not changed by this
		   specification.</t>
        <t>Depending on the rules governing a non-URN identifier system and its
                   associated URN namespace, names that
		   are valid in that identifier system might 
                   contain characters that are
		   not allowed by the "pchar" production referenced above
		   (e.g., characters outside the ASCII range or, consistent
		   with the restrictions in RFC 3986, the characters "/",
		   "?", "#", "[", and "]").  While such a name might be
		   valid within the non-URN identifier system, it is not a valid URN until it has been
		   translated into an NSS that conforms to the
                   rules of that particular URN namespace.  In the case of URNs
		   that are formed from names that exist separately in 
		   a non-URN identifier system, translation of a name
		   from its "native" format to URN format is accomplished by
		   using the canonicalization and encoding methods defined
		   for URNs in general or specific rules for that URN
		   namespace.   Software that is not aware of
		   namespace-specific canonicalization and encoding
		   rules MUST NOT construct URNs from the name in the
		   non-URN identifier system.
		</t>

				 language from 2141...".  No action taken 
				 yet (20160110) other than the text below-->
		<t>In particular, with regard to characters outside the ASCII
		   range, URNs that appear in protocols or that are
		   passed between systems MUST use only Unicode characters encoded
		   in UTF-8 and further encoded as required by RFC 3986.
		   To the extent feasible consistent with the requirements of
		   names defined and standardized elsewhere, as well as the
		   principles discussed in <xref target="tradeoffs"/>,
		   the characters used to represent names SHOULD be restricted to 
                   either ASCII letters and
		   digits or to the characters and syntax of some widely-used
		   model such as those of
		   IDNA <xref target="RFC5890"/>, 
		   PRECIS <xref target="RFC7613"/>, or
		   the Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax specification
		   <xref target="UAX31"/>.</t>

		<t>In order to make URNs as stable and persistent as possible when protocols evolve and the environment around them changes, URN namespaces SHOULD NOT allow characters outside the basic Latin repertoire <xref target='RFC20'/> unless the nature of the particular URN namespace makes such characters necessary.</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Optional Components' anchor='syntax-components'>
        <t>This specification includes three optional components in
		   the URN syntax.  They are known as r-component,
		   q-component, and f-component and are described in more
		   detail below.
		   Because this specification focuses almost exclusively on
		   URN syntax, it does not define detailed semantics of these
		   components for URNs in general.  However, each of these
		   components has a distinct role that is independent of any given URN and its URN namespace.  It is intended that clients will be able to handle these components uniformly for all URNs.
		   These components MAY be used with URNs from existing URN namespaces, whether or not
		   a URN namespace explicitly supports them.  However, consistent
		   with the approach taken in RFC 3986, the behavior of a URN
		   that contains components that are undefined or meaningless for a
		   particular URN namespace or resource is not defined.
		   The following sections describe these optional components and their interpretation in
		   greater detail.</t>

        <section title='r-component' anchor='syntax-r'>
          <t>The r-component is intended for passing parameters to URN resolution services (taken broadly, see <xref target="tradeoffs"/>) and interpreted by those services.  (By contrast, passing parameters to the resources identified by a URN, or to applications that manage such resources, is handled by q-components as described in the next section.)</t>
     	  <t>The URN r-component has no syntactic counterpart in any
			 other known URI scheme.</t>
          <t>The sequence "?+" introduces the r-component.
                        The r-component ends with a
			"?=" sequence (which begins a q-component) or a "#" character (number
			sign, which begins an f-component).  If neither of those appear, the
			r-component continues to the end of the URN.
            Note that
            characters outside the ASCII range <xref target='RFC20'/>
			MUST be percent-encoded using the method defined
			in Section 2.1 of the generic URI specification <xref target="RFC3986"/>.</t>
		 <t>As described under <xref target='equivalence'/>, the
			r-component SHALL NOT be taken into account when determining
			URN-equivalence.  However, the r-component SHALL be
			supplied along with the URN when presenting a request to
			a URN resolution service.</t>
		 <t>This document defines only the syntax of the
            r-component and reserves it for future use.  The exact
            semantics of the r-component and its use in URN resolution
            protocols are a matter for potential standardization in
            separate specifications, presumably including
			specifications that define conventions and a registry for
			resolution service identifiers.</t>
		  <t>Consider the hypothetical
            example of passing parameters to a resolution service (say,
            an ISO alpha-2 country code <xref target='ISO.3166-1'/> in
            order to select the preferred country in which to
            search for a physical copy of a book).  This could perhaps
            be accomplished by specifying the country code in the
            r-component, resulting in URNs such as:</t>
		  <t><list style="empty">
             <t>urn:example:foo-bar-baz-qux?+CCResolve:cc=uk</t></list></t>
		  <t> While the above should serve as a general explanation
			 and illustration of the intent for r-components, there
			 are many open issues with them, including their
			 relationship to resolution mechanisms associated with the
			 particular URN namespace at registration time.
			 Thus r-components SHOULD NOT be used for actual URNs until
			 additional development and standardization work is
			 complete, including specification of any necessary
			 registration mechanisms.</t>
        </section>

        <section title='q-component' anchor='syntax-q'>
          <t>The q-component is intended for passing parameters to either the named resource or a system that can supply the requested service, for interpretation by that resource or system.  (By contrast, passing parameters to URN resolution services is handled by r-components as described in the previous section.)</t>

			     the below.
			 -->
			 The URN q-component has the same syntax as the URI query component,
			 but is introduced by "?=", not "?" alone.  For URNs that may
			 be resolved to a URI for a locator, the semantics of the q-component are
			 identical to those for the query component of that URI.  Thus URN
			 resolvers returning a locator URI for a URN with a q-component do this by
			 copying the q-component from the URN to the query component of the
			 locator URI.
			 An example of the copying operation appears below.</t>
		  <t>This specification does not specify a required behavior
			 in the case of URN resolution to a locator when the
			 original URN has a q-component and the locator has a
			 query string. Different circumstance may require
			 different approaches.  Resolvers SHOULD document their
			 strategy in such cases.</t>

    <section title='URN-Equivalence' anchor='equivalence'>
      <section title='Procedure' anchor='equivalence-procedure'>
        <t>For various purposes such as caching, it is often
		   desirable to determine if two URNs are "the same".  This
		   is done most generally (i.e., independent of the scheme) by testing for equivalence (see Section 6.1 of <xref target='RFC3986'/>).</t>
        <t>The generic URI specification <xref target='RFC3986'/> is
		   very flexible about 
		   equality comparisons, putting the focus on allowing false
		   negatives and avoiding false positives.  If comparisons
		   are made in a scheme-independent way, i.e., as URI
		   comparisons only, many URNs that this specification considers
		   equal would be rejected.  The discussion below applies
		   when the URIs involved are known to be URNs, and thus uses
                   the terms "URN-equivalent" and "URN-equivalence"
                   to refer to equivalence as specified in this document.</t> 
        <t>Two URNs are URN-equivalent if their &lt;assigned-name&gt; portions are octet-by-octet equal after applying case normalization (as specified in Section 6.2.2.1 of <xref target='RFC3986'/>) to the following constructs:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>the URI scheme "urn", by conversion to lower case</t>
            <t>the NID, by conversion to lower case</t>
            <t>any percent-encoded characters in the NSS (that is, all character triplets that match the &lt;pct-encoding&gt; production found in Section 2.1 of the base URI specification <xref target='RFC3986'/>), by conversion to upper case for the digits A-F.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Percent-encoded characters MUST NOT be decoded, i.e., percent-encoding normalization (as specified in Section 6.2.2.2 of <xref target='RFC3986'/>)
		   MUST NOT be applied as part of the comparison process.</t>
        <t>If an r-component, q-component, or f-component (or any
		   combination thereof) is included in a URN, it MUST be
		   ignored for purposes of determining URN-equivalence.</t>
        <t>URN namespace definitions MAY include additional rules for
		   URN-equivalence, such as case-insensitivity of the NSS (or parts thereof).  Such rules MUST always have the effect of eliminating some of the false negatives obtained by the procedure above and MUST NOT result in treating two URNs as not "the same" if the procedure here says they are URN-equivalent.  For related considerations with regard to NID registration, see below.</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Examples' anchor='equivalence-examples'>
        <t>This section shows a variety of URNs (using the "example"
		   NID defined in <xref target='RFC6963'/>) that highlight
		   the URN-equivalence rules.</t>
        <t>First, because the scheme and NID are case-insensitive, the following three URNs are URN-equivalent to each other:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456</t>
            <t>URN:example:a123,z456</t>
            <t>urn:EXAMPLE:a123,z456</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Second, because the r-component, q-component, and f-component are not
		   taken into account for purposes of testing URN-equivalence, the following three URNs are URN-equivalent to the first three examples above:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456?+abc</t>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456?=xyz</t>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456#789</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Third, because the "/" character (and anything that follows
		   it) in the NSS is taken into account for purposes of
		   URN-equivalence, the following URNs are not URN-equivalent to each
		   other or to the six preceding URNs:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456/foo</t>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456/bar</t>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456/baz</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Fourth, because of percent-encoding, the following URNs
		   are URN-equivalent only to each other and not to any of
		   those above (note that, although %2C is the
		   percent-encoded transformation of "," from the previous
		   examples, such sequences are not decoded for purposes of
		   testing URN-equivalence):</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>urn:example:a123%2Cz456</t>
            <t>URN:EXAMPLE:a123%2cz456</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Fifth, because characters in the NSS other than percent-encoded sequences are treated in a case-sensitive manner (unless otherwise specified for the URN namespace in question), the following URNs are not URN-equivalent to the first three URNs:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>urn:example:A123,z456</t>
            <t>urn:example:a123,Z456</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Sixth, on casual visual inspection of a URN presented in a human-oriented interface the following URN might appear the same as the first three URNs (because U+0430 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A can be confused with U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A), but it is not URN-equivalent to the first three URNs:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>urn:example:%D0%B0123,z456</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title='URI Conformance' anchor='conformance'>
      <section title='Use in URI Protocol Slots' anchor='uri-slots'>
        <t>Because a URN is, syntactically, a URI under the "urn" scheme, in theory a URN can be placed in any protocol slot that allows for a URI (to name just a few, the 'href' and 'src' attributes in HTML, the &lt;base/&gt; element in HTML, the 'xml:base' attribute in XML <xref target='XML-BASE'/>, and the 'xmlns' attribute in XML for XML namespace names <xref target='XML-NAMES'/>).</t>
        <t>However, this does not imply that, semantically, it always makes sense in practice to place a URN in a given URI protocol slot; in particular, because a URN might not specify the location of a resource or even point indirectly to one, it might not be appropriate to place a URN in a URI protocol slot that points to a resource (e.g., the aforementioned 'href' and 'src' attributes).</t>
        <t>Ultimately, guidelines regarding when it is appropriate to use URIs under the "urn" scheme (or any other scheme) are the responsibility of specifications for individual URI protocol slots (e.g., the specification for the 'xml:base' attribute in XML might recommend that it is inappropriate to use URNs in that protocol slot).  This specification cannot possibly anticipate all of the relevant cases, and it is not the place of this specification to require or restrict usage for individual protocol slots.</t>

      <section title='Parsing' anchor='uri-parsing'>
        <t>In part because of the separation of URN semantics from
		   more general URI syntax
		   <xref target='I-D.ietf-urnbis-semantics-clarif'/>,
		   generic URI processors need to pay special attention to the parsing and analysis rules of RFC 3986 and, in particular, must treat the URI as opaque unless the scheme and its requirements are recognized.  In the latter case, such processors may be in a position to invoke scheme-appropriate processing, e.g., by a URN resolver.  A URN resolver can either be an external resolver that the URI resolver knows of, or it can be functionality built into the URI resolver.  Note that this requirement might impose constraints on the contexts in which URNs are appropriately used; see <xref target='uri-slots'/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section title='URNs and Relative References' anchor='uri-rr'>
        <t> Section 5.2 of <xref target='RFC3986'/> describes an algorithm for converting a URI reference that might be relative to a given base URI into "parsed components" of the target of that reference, which can then be recomposed per RFC 3986 Section 5.3 into a target URI.
		   This algorithm is problematic for URNs because their syntax does not support the necessary path components.
		   However, if the algorithm is applied independent of a
		   particular scheme, it should work predictably for URNs as
		   well, with the following understandings (syntax production
		   terminology taken from RFC 3986):
		   <list style="numbers">
			  <t>A system that encounters a &lt;URI-reference&gt;
				 that obeys the syntax for &lt;relative-ref&gt;,
				 whether it explicitly has the scheme "urn" or not,
				 will convert it into a target URI as specified in
				 RFC 3986.</t>
			  <t>Because of the persistence and stability
				 expectations of URNs, authors of documents, etc.,
				 that utilize URNs should generally avoid the use of
				 the "urn" scheme in any &lt;URI-reference&gt; that
				 is not strictly a &lt;URI&gt; as specified in
				 RFC 3986, specifically including those that would
				 require processing of &lt;relative-ref&gt;.
				 <vspace blankLines="0"/>
				 <cref>Henry's preferred version of the above is:
					"Because the result of (i) may well fail to be a
					valid URI, using a URN to identify a resource
					(any of) whose representation(s) may contain
					&lt;relative-ref&gt;s should be avoided."  WG
					should pick or figure out a way to combine the
					two.</cref>

		   Whenever a URN resolves to a URL which may be used to access the resource, there is a more specific interpretation of q-component and f-component: the q-component is copied verbatim to the query portion of the URL (if that URL scheme supports query), and the f-component is copied verbatim to the fragment portion of the URL.  Even though the notion of a URN as a "persistent", "permanent" identifier does not reconcile easily with relative referencing, resources named with URNs may contain relative references that do not apply to the URN itself.</t>
        <t>Given the foregoing, a relative reference SHOULD NOT be evaluated directly with respect to a URN.   Instead, a relative reference SHOULD be evaluated indirectly with respect to one of the following:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>a base URI (other than a URN) declared by the resource itself; or</t>
            <t>a base URI (other than a URN) obtained through the URN resolution process; or</t>
            <t>the URL of the resource as obtained through the URN resolution process</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>(Case 2 permits the resolution process to explicitly supply a base URI if the resource content is supplied directly by the resolution service rather than via an intermediate "location" URI.)</t>
        <t>If no such base URI exists, use of a relative reference with respect to a URN is an error.  Client behavior in this case is undefined.</t>      
        <t>Resolution services SHOULD ensure that a base URI is supplied whenever they provide resource content directly to a client.</t>

      <section title='Transport and Display' anchor='uri-display'>
        <t>When URNs are transported and exchanged, they MUST be represented in the format defined herein.  Further, all URN-aware applications MUST offer the option of displaying URNs in this canonical form to allow for direct transcription (for example by copy-and-paste techniques).  Such applications might support display of URNs in a more human-friendly form and might use a character set that includes characters that are not permitted in URN syntax as defined in this specification (e.g., when displaying URNs to humans, such applications might replace percent-encoded strings with characters from an extended character repertoire such as Unicode <xref target='UNICODE'/>).</t>
        <t>To minimize user confusion, any application displaying
		   URIs SHOULD display the complete URI (including, for URNs, the "urn" scheme and any components) to ensure that there is no confusion between URN NIDs and URI scheme identifiers.  For example, a URI beginning with "urn:xmpp:" <xref target='RFC4854'/> is very different from a URI beginning with "xmpp:" <xref target='RFC5122'/>.  Similarly, a potential DOI URI scheme <xref target="DOI-URI"/> is different from, and possibly completely unrelated to, a possible DOI URN namespace.</t>

Although design of the URNs to be assigned within a given URN namespace is ceded by this specification to the URN namespace manager, doing so in a managed way avoids the problems inherent in unmanaged generation of URIs as described in the recommendations regarding URI design and ownership <xref target='RFC7320'/>.</t>

    <section title='URN Namespaces' anchor='ns'>
      <t>A URN namespace is a collection of names that obey three constraints: each name is (1) unique, (2) assigned in a consistent way, and (3) assigned according to a common definition.</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>The "uniqueness" constraint means that a name within the URN namespace is never assigned to more than one resource and never reassigned to a different resource (for the kind of "resource" identified by URNs assigned within the URN namespace).  This holds true even if the name itself is deprecated or becomes obsolete.</t>
          <t>The "consistent assignment" constraint means that a name within the URN namespace is assigned by an organization or created in accordance with a process or algorithm that is always followed.</t>
          <t>The "common definition" constraint means that there are clear definitions for the syntax of names within the URN namespace and for the process of assigning or creating them.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>A URN namespace is identified by a particular NID in order to ensure the global uniqueness of URNs and, optionally, to provide a cue regarding the structure of URNs assigned within a URN namespace.</t>
      <t>With regard to global uniqueness, using different NIDs for different collections of names ensures that no two URNs will be the same for different resources, because each collection is required to uniquely assign each name.  However, a single resource MAY have more than one URN assigned to it, either in the same URN namespace (if the URN namespace permits it) or in different URN namespaces, and either for similar purposes or different purposes.
		 (For example, if a publisher assigns an ISBN <xref target='RFC3187'/> to an
		 electronic publication and that publication is later
		 incorporated into a digital long-term archive operated by a
		 national library, the library might assign the publication an
		 NBN <xref target='RFC3188'/>, resulting in two URNs referring to the same book.)
		 <!-- Change above per Lars, 20160224 -->
		 Subject to other constraints, such as those imposed by the URI syntax <xref target='RFC3986'/>, the rules of the URN scheme are intended to allow preserving the normal and natural form of names specified in non-URN identifier systems when they are treated as URNs.</t>
      <t>With regard to the structure of names assigned within a URN namespace, the development of a naming structure (and thereby a collection of names) depends on the requirements of the community defining the names, how the names will be assigned and used, etc.  These issues are beyond the scope of URN syntax and the general rules for URN namespaces, because they are specific to the community defining a non-URN identifier system or a particular URN namespace (e.g., the bibliographic and publishing communities in the case of the 'ISBN' URN namespace <xref target='RFC3187'/> and the 'ISSN' URN namespace <xref target='RFC3044'/>, or the developers of extensions to the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol <xref target='RFC6120'/> in the case of the 'XMPP' URN namespace <xref target='RFC4854'/>).</t>
      <t>URN namespaces inherit certain rights and responsibilities by the nature of URNs, in particular:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>They uphold the general principles of a well-managed URN namespace by providing persistent identification of resources and unique assignment of names in accordance with a common definition.</t>
          <t>Optionally, they can be registered in global
			 registration services such as those described in <xref target="RFC2483"/>.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>There are two types of URN namespace: formal and informal.  These are distinguished by the expected level of service, the information needed to define the URN namespace, and the procedures for registration.  Because the majority of the URN namespaces registered so far have been formal, this document concentrates on formal URN namespaces.</t>

      <section title='Formal URN Namespaces' anchor='ns-formal'>
        <t>A formal URN namespace provides benefit to some subset of
		   users on the Internet.  In particular, it would not make
		   sense for a formal URN namespace to be used only by a
		   community or network that is not connected to the
		   Internet.  For example, it would be inappropriate for a
		   URN namespace to effectively force someone to use a proprietary
		   network or service not open to the general Internet user.
		   The intent is that, while the community of those who might
		   actively use the URNs assigned within that URN namespace might be
		   small, the potential use of names within that URN namespace is
		   open to any user on the Internet.  Formal URN namespaces might be
		   appropriate even when some aspects are not fully open.  For
		   example, a URN namespace might make use of a fee-based,
		   privately managed, or proprietary registry for assignment
		   of URNs in the URN namespace.  However, it might still benefit
		   some Internet users if the associated services have
		   openly-published names.</t>
        <t>An organization that will assign URNs within a formal URN namespace SHOULD meet 
           the following criteria:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>Organizational stability and the ability to maintain the URN namespace for a long time; absent such evidence, it ought to be clear how the URN namespace can remain viable if the organization can no longer maintain the URN namespace.</t>
            <t>Competency in URN assignment.  This will improve the likelihood of persistence (e.g., to minimize the likelihood of conflicts).</t>
            <t>Commitment to not reassigning existing URNs and to allowing old URNs to continue to be valid (e.g., if the assignee of a URN is no longer a member or customer of the assigning organization, if various information about the assignee or named entity happens to change, or even if the assignee or the named entity itself is no longer in existence; in all these cases, the URN is still valid).</t>  
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>A formal URN namespace establishes a particular NID, subject to the following constraints (above and beyond the syntax rules already specified):</t>

               country-code-based URN namespaces are beyond the scope of this 
               document). As a consequence, it MUST NOT start with the string
               "xn--" or any other string consisting of two letters
              followed by two hyphens; such strings are reserved

		<t>	Applicants and reviewers considering new NIDs should

        <t>Informal URN namespaces are full-fledged URN namespaces, with all the associated rights and responsibilities.  Informal URN namespaces differ from formal URN namespaces in the process for assigning a NID: for an informal URN namespace, the registrant does not designate the NID; instead, IANA assigns a NID consisting of the string 'urn-' followed by one or more digits (e.g., "urn-7") where the digits consist of the next available number in the sequence of positive integers assigned to informal URN namespaces.  Thus the syntax of an informal URN namespace identifier is:</t>

        <t>The basic registration policy for URN namespaces is Expert

		   definitions that are intended to become standards or
		   constituent parts of standards, the output of the Expert
		   Review process is intended to be a report, rather than
		   instructions to IANA to take action (see below).
		   The key steps are:</t>   
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>Fill out the URN namespace registration template (see
			   <xref target='definition-template'/> and

            <t>If the designated experts approve the request and no
			   standardization action is involved, the IANA will
			   register the requested NID.  If standardization is
			   anticipated, the designated experts will prepare a
			   report and forward it to the appropriate standards
			   approval body (the IESG in the case of the IETF); 
			   IANA will register the requested NID only after
			   receiving directions from that body and a copy of the
			   expert review report.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>A URN namespace registration can be revised by updating
		   the registration template, following the same steps
		   outlined above for new registrations.  A revised
		   registration MUST describe differences from prior versions
		   and SHOULD make special note of any relevant
		   changes in the underlying technologies or URN namespace
		   management processes.</t>
        <t>Experience to date with URN namespace registration requests has shown that 
           registrants sometimes do not initially understand some of the subtleties 
           of URN namespaces, and that defining the URN namespace in the form of a 
           specification enables the registrants to clearly formulate their "contract" 
           with the intended user community.  Therefore, although the registration 
           policy for formal URN namespaces is Expert Review and a
		   specification (as distinct from the registration template) is 
           not strictly required, registrants SHOULD provide a stable 
           specification documenting the URN namespace definition and expanding upon the
           issues described herein.</t>
        <t>Because naming can be difficult and contentious, URN namespace registrants and the
           designated experts are strongly encouraged to work together in a spirit of good 
           faith and mutual understanding to achieve rough consensus 
           (see <xref target='RFC7282'/>) on handling registration 
           requests.  They are also encouraged to bring additional expertise into the 
           discussion if that would be helpful in providing perspective or otherwise 
           resolving issues.</t>
		<t>Especially when iterations in the registration process are
		   prolonged, designated experts are expected to take
		   reasonable precautions to avoid "race conditions" on proposed
		   NIDs and, if such situations arise, to encourage
		   applicants to work out any conflicts among themselves.</t>

            <t>Any special character encoding rules for assigned URNs
			   (e.g., which character ought to always be used for
			   quotes).</t>
            <t>Rules for determining URN-equivalence between two
			   names in the URN namespace.  Such rules ought to
			   always have the effect of eliminating false negatives
			   that might otherwise result from comparison.  If it is
			   appropriate and helpful, reference can be made to
			   particular equivalence rules defined in the URI
			   specification <xref target='RFC3986'/> or to
			   <xref target='equivalence'/> of this document.
			   <!-- See Tracker, "2141bis: Equivalence rules #8" -->
			   Examples of URN-equivalence rules include equivalence between
			   uppercase and lowercase characters in the NSS,
			   between hyphenated and non-hyphenated
			   groupings in the name, or between
			   single-quotes and double-quotes.
			   There may also be namespace-specific special encoding
			   considerations, especially for URNs that contain
			   embedded forms of names from non-URN identifier systems. 
			   <!-- Added per JcK to Keith message 2015-03-31 on "% encoding
			   issues" -->
			   (Note that these are
			   not normative statements for any kind of best practice
			   related to handling of relationships between characters
			   in general; such statements are limited to one particular URN namespace only.)</t>
            <t>Any special considerations necessary for conforming with
			   the URN syntax.  This is particularly applicable in the
			   case of existing, non-URN identifier systems that are used in the context of URNs.  For example, if a non-URN identifier system is used in contexts other than URNs, it might make use of characters that are reserved in the URN syntax.  This section ought to note any such characters, and outline necessary mappings to conform to URN syntax.  Normally, this will be handled by percent-encoding the character as specified in Section 2.1 of
			   the URI specification <xref target='RFC3986'/> and as discussed in
			   <xref target="tradeoffs-encoding"/> of this specification.</t>
            <t>Any special considerations for the meaning of q-components (e.g., keywords) or f-components (e.g., predefined terms) in the context of this URN namespace.</t>

<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

<t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).&lt;/t>&lt;t> In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document obsoletes RFC 2434.

<t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract><t>Experience has shown that identifiers associated with persistent names have properties and requirements that may be somewhat different from identifiers associated with the locations of objects.  This is especially true when such names are expected to be stable for a very long time or when they identify large and complex entities.  In order to allow Uniform Resource Names (URNs) to evolve to meet the needs of the Library, Museum, Publisher, and Informational Sciences communities and other users, this specification separates URNs from the semantic constraints that many people believe are part of the specification for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) specified in RFC 3986, updating that document accordingly.  The syntax of URNs is still constrained to that of RFC 3986, so generic URI parsers are unaffected by this change.</t></abstract>

<t>
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are intended to serve as persistent,
   location-independent, resource identifiers. This document sets
   forward the canonical syntax for URNs.  A discussion of both existing
   legacy and new namespaces and requirements for URN presentation and
   transmission are presented.  Finally, there is a discussion of
   URN equivalence and how to determine it.

<t>
   This document addresses the issues of the discovery of URN (Uniform
   Resource Name) resolver services that in turn will directly translate
   URNs into URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and URCs (Uniform Resource
   Characteristics).  The document falls into three major parts, the
   assumptions underlying the work, the guidelines in order to be a
   viable Resolver Discovery Service or RDS, and a framework for
   designing RDSs.  The guidelines fall into three principle areas:
   evolvability, usability, and security and privacy.  An RDS that is
   compliant with the framework will not necessarily be compliant with
   the guidelines.  Compliance with the guidelines will need to be
   validated separately.

<abstract>
<t>
   Retrieving the resource identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI)  is only one of the operations that can be performed on a
   URI.  One might also ask for and get a list of other identifiers that
   are aliases for the original URI or a bibliographic description of
   the resource the URI denotes, for example. This applies to both
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
   Uniform Resource Characteristics (URCs) are discussed in this
   document but only as descriptions of resources rather than
   identifiers.
</t>
<t>
   A service in the network providing access to a resource may provide
   one or some of these options, but it need not provide all of them.
   This memo specifies an initial set of these operations that can be
   used to describe the interactions provided by a given access service.
   It also suggests guidelines that should be adhered to when those
   operations are encoded in a protocol.

The URN WG has defined a syntax for URNs in RFC 2141, as well as some proposed mechanisms for their resolution and use in Internet applications in RFC 3401 and RFC 3405.  The whole rests on the concept of individual "namespaces" within the URN structure.  Apart from proof-of-concept namespaces, the use of existing identifiers in URNs has been discussed in RFC 2288.

<abstract>
<t>Identifiers such as hostnames, URIs, IP addresses, and email addresses are often used in security contexts to identify security principals and resources.  In such contexts, an identifier presented via some protocol is often compared using some policy to make security decisions such as whether the security principal may access the resource, what level of authentication or encryption is required, etc.  If the parties involved in a security decision use different algorithms to compare identifiers, then failure scenarios ranging from denial of service to elevation of privilege can result.  This document provides a discussion of these issues that designers should consider when defining identifiers and protocols, and when constructing architectures that use multiple protocols.</t></abstract></front>

<title>On Consensus and Humming in the IETF</title>
<author initials='P.' surname='Resnick' fullname='P. Resnick'>
<organization /></author>
<date year='2014' month='June' />
<abstract>
<t>The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work through a consensus process, taking into account the different views among IETF participants and coming to (at least rough) consensus on technical matters. In particular, the IETF is supposed not to be run by a "majority rule" philosophy. This is why we engage in rituals like "humming" instead of voting. However, more and more of our actions are now indistinguishable from voting, and quite often we are letting the majority win the day without consideration of minority concerns. This document explains some features of rough consensus, what is not rough consensus, how we have gotten away from it, how we might think about it differently, and the things we can do in order to really achieve rough consensus.&lt;/t>&lt;t> Note: This document is quite consciously being put forward as Informational. It does not propose to change any IETF processes and is therefore not a BCP. It is simply a collection of principles, hopefully around which the IETF can come to (at least rough) consensus.</t></abstract></front>

<t>Section 1.1.1 of RFC 3986 defines URI syntax as "a federated and extensible naming system wherein each scheme's specification may further restrict the syntax and semantics of identifiers using that scheme." In other words, the structure of a URI is defined by its scheme.  While it is common for schemes to further delegate their substructure to the URI's owner, publishing independent standards that mandate particular forms of URI substructure is inappropriate, because that essentially usurps ownership.  This document further describes this problematic practice and provides some acceptable alternatives for use in standards.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract><t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to provide a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the User Agent (UA) as an alerting signal (e.g., a ring tone or ringback tone) when the user is alerted.  This is done using the Alert-Info header field.  However, the reference (typically a URL) addresses only a specific network resource with specific rendering properties.  There is currently no support for standard identifiers for describing the semantics of the alerting situation or the characteristics of the alerting signal, without being tied to a particular rendering.  To overcome these limitations and support new applications, a new family of URNs for use in Alert-Info header fields (and situations with similar requirements) is defined in this specification.</t><t>This document normatively updates RFC 3261, which defines the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  It changes the usage of the Alert-Info header field defined in RFC 3261 by additionally allowing its use in any non-100 provisional response to INVITE.  This document also permits proxies to add or remove an Alert-Info header field and to add or remove Alert-Info header field values.</t></abstract>

    <section title='Changes from RFC 2141' anchor='changes-2141'>	   
      <t>This document makes substantive changes from the syntax
		 and semantics of <xref target='RFC2141'/>:</t>
	  <section title="Syntax changes from RFC 2141">
      <t>The syntax of URNs as provided in <xref target='RFC2141'/> was defined before the updated specification of URIs in <xref target='RFC3986'/>.  The definition of URN syntax is updated in this document to do the following:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Ensure consistency with the URI syntax.</t>
          <t>Facilitate the use of URNs with parameters similar to URI queries and fragments.</t>
          <t>Permit parameters influencing URN resolution.</t>
          <t>Ease the use of URNs with non-URN identifier systems that include the '/' character.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>In particular, this specification does the following:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Extends URN syntax to explicitly allow the characters
			 '/', "?", and "#", which were reserved for future use by
			 RFC 2141.  This change effectively also allows several components
			 of the URI syntax although without necessarily tying
			 those components to URI semantics.</t> 
          <t>Defines general syntax for an additional component that
			 can be used in interactions with a URN resolution service.</t>
          <t>Disallows "-" at the end of a NID.</t>
          <t>Allows the "/", "~", and "&amp;" characters in the namespace-specific string (NSS).</t>
          <t>Makes several smaller syntax adjustments.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
	  </section>
	  <section title="Other changes from RFC 2141">	 
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Formally registers 'urn' as a URI scheme.</t>
          <t>Allows what are now called r-components, q-components, and f-components.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>In addition, some of the text has been updated to be
		 consistent with the definition of Uniform Resource
		 Identifiers (URIs) <xref target='RFC3986'/> and the
		 processes for registering information with the IANA
		 <xref target='RFC5226'/>, as well as more modern guidance
		 with regard to security <xref target='RFC3552'/>,
		 privacy <xref target="RFC6973"/>,
		 and identifier comparison <xref target='RFC6943'/>.</t>

    <section title='Changes from RFC 3406' anchor='changes-3406'>
      <t>This document makes the following substantive changes from <xref target='RFC3406'/>:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Relaxes the registration policy for formal URN namespaces
			 from "IETF Review" to "Expert Review" as discussed in
			 <xref target='definition-registration-community'/>.</t>
          <t>Removes the category of experimental URN namespaces,
			 consistent with <xref target='RFC6648'/>.  Experimental
			 URN namespaces were denoted by prefixing the namespace
			 identifier with the string "X-". Because experimental
			 URN namespaces were never registered, removing the
			 experimental category has no impact on the existing
			 registries.  Because experimental URN namespaces are
                         not managed, strings conforming to URN syntax within
			 experimental URN namespaces are not valid
			 URNs.  Truly experimental usages MAY, of course, employ
			 the 'example' namespace <xref target='RFC6963'/>.</t>
          <t>Adds some information to, but generally simplifies, the
			 URN namespace registration template.</t>
