    <section title='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
      <t>A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) <xref target='RFC3986'/> that is assigned under the "urn" scheme and a particular namespace, with the intent that the URN will be either a persistent, location-independent resource identifier or in some cases an abstract designator that is persistent but that does not identify a resource.  A URN namespace is a collection of such names, each of which is (1) unique, (2) assigned in a consistent and managed way, and (3) assigned according to a common definition.  (Some URN namespaces create names that exist only as URNs, whereas others create URNs out of identifiers that already exist in other identifier systems, such as ISBNs <xref target='RFC3187'/> and ISSNs <xref target='RFC3044'/>.)</t>
      <t>The assignment of URNs is done by an organization (or, in some cases, according to an algorithm or other automated process) that has been formally delegated a namespace within the "urn" scheme (e.g., a URN in the 'example' namespace <xref target='RFC6963'/> might be of the form "urn:example:foo").</t>
      <t>This document rests on two key assumptions:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Assignment of a URN is a managed process.</t>
          <t>The space of URN namespaces is itself managed.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>While other URI schemes may allow identifiers to be freely chosen and assigned, such is not the case for URNs.  The syntactical correctness of a string starting with "urn:" is not sufficient to make it a URN.  In order for the string to be a valid URN, the namespace identifier needs to be registered in accordance with the rules defined here and the remaining parts of the assigned-name portion of the URN needs to be generated in accordance with the rules for the registered namespace.</t>
      <t>So that information about both URN syntax and URN namespaces is available in one place, this document does the following:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Defines the canonical syntax for URNs in general (in a way that is consistent with URI syntax), specifies methods for determining URN equivalence, and discusses URI conformance.</t>
          <t>Specifies a method for defining a URN namespace and associating it with a namespace identifier, and describes procedures for registering namespace identifiers with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>For URN syntax and URN namespaces, this document modernizes and replaces
		 the definitions from the original URN syntax <xref target='RFC2141'/>
		 and namespace definition and registration <xref target='RFC3406'/>
		 specifications.  
		 These modifications build on the key requirements provided
		 in the original functional description for URN <xref target='RFC1737'/> and
		 many years of experience.
		 In both those original documents and the present one, the
		 intent is to define URNs in a consistent manner so that,
		 wherever practical, the parsing, handling, and resolution of
		 URNs can be independent of the namespace within which a
		 given URN is assigned. </t>
	  <t>Together with input from several key user
		 communities, the history and experiences dictated expansion of the URN definition
		 to support new functionality, including the use of syntax explicitly reserved
		 for future standardization in RFC 2141.  All namespaces and URNs that were
		 valid under the earlier specifications remain valid even though it may be
		 useful to update some of them to take advantage of new features. </t>
	  <t>Summaries of changes from RFC 2141 and RFC 3406 appear in
		 <xref target='changes-2141'/> and <xref target='changes-3406'/>
		 respectively.  This document obsoletes both
		 <xref target='RFC2141'/> and <xref target='RFC3406'/>.
	     While it does not explicitly update or replace <xref target="RFC1737"/>
		 or <xref target="RFC2276"/> the reader who references those
		 documents should be aware that the conceptual model of URNs
		 in this document is slightly different from those older
		 specifications. </t>

	<section title="Specificity and this Standard" anchor="weaselWords">
	   <t>To a degree much greater than when URNs were first
		  considered and their uses outlined
		  (Cf. <xref target="RFC1737"/>) issues of persistent
		  identifiers on the Internet involve fundamental design
		  tradeoffs and research questions that are much broader that
		  URNs or the URN approach.  Ideal and comprehensive
		  specifications about what should be done or required across
		  the entire range of URNs would require general agreement about
		  those issues and their resolution.  While some of them were
		  introduced by the Internet or computer-age approaches to
		  character encodings and data abstraction, others predate the
		  Internet and computer systems by centuries; there is
		  unlikely to be agreement about comprehensive
		  solutions in the near future.</t>
	   <t> Among these general issues, one that is specific to URNs
		  is the fairly abstract topic of "resolution",
		  discussed in <xref target="terms"/>,
		  <xref target='syntax-r'/>, and
		  elsewhere below.  While it is possible to define the
		  relationships quite precisely for a URN that resolves to a
		  URL that, in turn, resolves (or locates) to a single target
		  document or similar resource, that is only one special case
		  albeit an important one.  URNs (either individually or
		  entire namespaces as defined below) that do not resolve to URLs 
		  at all or that resolve to metadata or non-Internet objects
		  are among URN use cases explicitly permitted by this
		  specification; each leaves the concept of "resolution"
		  somewhat more abstract and difficult than the simple case of
		  resolution to a URL.</t>
	   <t>A similar set of issues arises for character sets and encodings.
		  URNs, especially URNs that will be used as user-facing
		  identifiers, should be convenient to use in local languages and
		  writing systems, easily specified with a wide range of keyboards
		  and local conventions, and unambiguous.  There are tradeoffs
		  among those goals and it is impossible at present to see how a simple
		  and readily-understandable set of rules could be developed that
		  would be optimal, or even reasonable, for all URNs.  The
		  discussion in <xref target='syntax-nss'/> defines an overall 
		  framework that should make generalized parsing and processing 
		  possible, but also makes recommendations about rules for 
		  individual namespaces.</t>
	   <t>This specification consequently contains some requirements
		  and flexibility that would not be present in a more perfect
		  world but that are necessary in order to allow producing any
		  consensus specification at all rather than just giving up on
		  URNs going forward.</t>

    <section title="Terminology" anchor="terms">
      <t>The following terms are distinguished from each other as described below:</t>

          <t hangText='URN namespace'>A managed collection of names that is associated with a URN namespace identifier (NID)</t>
          <t hangText='URN'>A name that is a member of a URN namespace</t>
          <t hangText='NSS'>The URN-namespace-specific part of a URN</t>
          <t hangText='Identifier system'>A managed collection of identifiers that exists outside of the URN system</t>

          <t hangText='Name'>A member of a URN namespace or of a (non-URN) identifier system</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>This document uses the terms "resolution" and "resolver" in
		 roughly the sense in which they were used in the original
		 discussion of architectural principles for
		 URNs <xref target='RFC2276'/>, i.e., "resolution" is the act
		 of supplying services related to the identified resource,
		 such as translating the persistent URN into one or more
		 current locators for the resource, delivering metadata about
		 the resource in an appropriate format,
		 or even delivering a document object from a convenient
		 source without requiring further intermediaries.
		    <!-- JcK: 20151111, per conversation with Henry Thompson -->
		 At the time of this writing, resolution services are
		 described in <xref target='RFC2483'/>.
		    <!-- JcK: 20151111: 2483 really makes no attempt to "define" -->
		 In order to underline the difference between the URNs and locators, this document uses the term Uniform Resource Locator (URL), rather than the generic term Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), to refer to locators; see also Section 1.1.3 of <xref target='RFC3986'/>.</t>

      <t>If there are or will be resolution services available for a
		 URN, this document calls the URN a "resource identifier" in
		 roughly the sense that term is used in <xref target='RFC3986'/>.  If there
		 is no intention to provide any resolution services, and the
		 distinction is important, this document calls the URN an
		 "abstract designator".</t> 
      <t>Several other important terms used in this document, including some "normalization" operations that are not part of the Unicode Standard <xref target='UNICODE'/>, are defined in the URI specification <xref target='RFC3986'/>.</t>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.</t>

    <section title='URN Syntax' anchor='syntax'>
	   <t>As discussed above, the syntax for URNs in this
		  specification allows significantly more functionality than
		  was the case in the earlier specifications.  It is also
		  harmonized with the general URI syntax
		  <xref target="RFC3986"/>.  That syntax definition was
		  completed after the earlier URN specifications. </t>
      <t>However, this specification does not extend the URN syntax
		 to allow direct use of characters outside the ASCII range
		 <xref target='RFC20'/>.  That prohibition implies that any such
		 characters need to be percent-encoded as described in
		 Section 2.1 of the URI specification
		 <xref target='RFC3986'/>.</t>
      <t>The basic syntax for a URN is defined using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as specified in <xref target='RFC5234'/>.  Rules not defined here (specifically: alphanum, fragment, and pchar) are defined as part of the URI syntax <xref target='RFC3986'/>
		 and used here to point out the syntactic relationship with
		 the terms used there.  The definitions of some of the terms
		 used below are not complete; additional restrictions are
		 imposed sections of the document that are specific to those
		 terms.</t>

      </section>

      <section title='Namespace Specific String (NSS)' anchor='syntax-nss'>
        <t>The namespace specific string (NSS) is a unique identifier
		   within a namespace that is assigned and managed in a consistent way and that conforms to the definition of the relevant namespace.  The combination of the NID (unique across the entire "urn" scheme) and the NSS (unique within the namespace) ensures that the resulting URN is a globally unique URI.</t>
        <t>The NSS specified in this document allows characters not
		   permitted by earlier specifications
		   (see <xref target='changes-2141'/>. In particular, the "/"
		   character, which is now allowed, effectively makes it possible
		   to encapsulate hierarchical identifiers from other naming systems.  For instance, consider the hypothetical example of a hierarchical naming system in which the identifiers take the
		   form of a sequence of numbers separated by the "/" character, such as "1/406/47452/2".  If the naming authority for such identifiers were to use URNs, it would be natural to place the existing identifiers in the NSS, resulting in URNs such as "urn:example:1/406/47452/2".</t>
        <t>The changes to the syntax for the NSS do not modify the encoding rules for URN namespaces that were defined in accordance with <xref target='RFC2141'/>.  If any such URN namespace that is used outside of the URN context
		   (i.e., as a standalone, non-embedded, identifier space)
		   also allows the use of "/", "~", or "&amp;" in the native
		   form within that identifier space, then the encoding rules
		   for that namespace are not changed by this
		   specification.</t>

		   example.  Applying his suggested fix will take some thought

        <t>Depending on the rules governing a namespace, strings that
		   are valid in an NSS associated with that namespace might 
                   contain characters that are
		   not allowed by the "pchar" production referenced above
		   (e.g., characters outside the ASCII range or, consistent
		   with the restrictions in RFC 3986, the characters "/",
		   "?", "#", "[", and "]").  While such a string might be a
		   valid name, it is not a valid URN until it has been
		   translated into a conformant NSS.  In the case of URNs
		   that are formed from identifiers that exist separately in 
		   another identifier space, translation of an identifier
		   from its "native" format to URN format is accomplished by
		   using the canonicalization and encoding methods defined
		   for that URN namespace.  Software that is not aware of
		   those namespace-specific canonicalization and encoding
		   rules MUST NOT construct URNs from the identifiers in the
		   other identifier space.

				 language from 2141...".  No action taken 
				 yet (20160110) other than the text below-->
		<t>In particular, with regard to characters outside the ASCII
		   range, URNs that appear in protocols or that are
		   passed between systems MUST use only Unicode characters encoded
		   in UTF-8 and further encoded as required by RFC 3986.
		   To the extent feasible consistent with the requirements of
		   identifiers defined and standardized elsewhere and the
		   principles discussed in <xref target="weaselWords"/>,
		   strings SHOULD be restricted to either ASCII letters and
		   digits or to the characters and syntax of some widely-used
		   identifier model such as those of
		   IDNA <xref target="RFC5890"/>, 
		   PRECIS <xref target="RFC7613"/>, or
		   the Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax spec
		   <xref target="UAX31"/>.</t>

		<t>In order to make URNs as stable and persistent as possible when protocols evolve and the environment around them changes, namespaces SHOULD NOT allow characters outside the basic Latin repertoire <xref target='RFC20'/> unless the nature of the particular namespace makes such characters necessary.</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Optional Components' anchor='syntax-components'>
        <t>This specification includes three optional components in
		   the URN syntax.  They are known as q-component,
		   r-component, and f-component and are described in more
		   detail below.
		   Because this specification focuses almost exclusively on
		   URN syntax, it does not define detailed semantics of these
		   components for URNs in general.  However, each of these
		   components has a distinct role that is independent of the URN and its namespace.  It is intended that clients will be able to handle these components uniformly for all URNs.
		   These components MAY be used with URNs from existing namespaces, whether or not
		   a namespace explicitly supports them.  However, consistent
		   with the approach taken in RFC 3986, the behavior of a URN
		   that contains components that are undefined or meaningless for a
		   particular namespace or resource is not defined.
		   The following sections describe these optional components and their interpretation in greater detail.</t>

        <!-- PSA 2016-04-13 I think we can remove the following two paragraphs now that the content has been sprinkled into the subsections below...
        <t>Whenever a URN resolves to a URL which may be used to access the resource, there is a more specific interpretation of q-component and f-component: the q-component is copied verbatim to the query portion of the URL (if that URL scheme supports query), and the f-component is copied verbatim to the fragment portion of the URL.   This is necessary, among other reasons, so that interpretation of q-component and f-component, when associated with URNs, will be consistent with the interpretation of relative references containing queries or fragments within documents which are ultimately accessible via URNs.  Thus, for URNs which may be resolved to a URL, the semantics of q-component are identical to those for queries to that resource and the semantics of f-components are identical to those of fragments for that resource.   The semantics of q-component and f-component for URNs that inherently cannot be resolved to a URL (e.g., for abstract designators) are undefined by this document; however, they SHOULD be consistent with the above roles.</t>
        <t>In general and for the sake of consistency with RFC 3986, neither the general syntax nor the semantics of q-components or f-components are defined by, or dependent on, the namespace of the URN.  In parallel with RFC 3896, specifics of syntax and semantics, e.g., which keywords or terms are meaningful, of course may depend on a particular namespace or even the particular resource under discussion.</t>

        <section title='q-component' anchor='syntax-q'>
          <t>The q-component is intended for passing parameters to either the named resource or a system that can supply the requested service, for interpretation by that resource or system.

          <t>The r-component is intended for passing parameters to URN resolution services (taken broadly, see <xref target="weaselWords"/>) and interpreted by those services.  (By contrast, passing parameters to the resources identified by a URN, or to applications that manage such resources, is handled by q-components as described in the previous section.)</t>
     	  <t>The URN r-component has no syntactic equivalent in URLs.</t>
          <t>The sequence "?+" introduces the r-component just as "?="
			 introduces the q-component as discussed above.  The r-component ends with a
			"?=" sequence (which begins a q-component) or a "#" character (number
			sign, which begins an f-component).  If neither of those appear, the
			r-component continues to the end of the URN.
            Note that
            characters outside the ASCII range <xref target='RFC20'/>

		 <t>This document defines only the syntax of the

            semantics of the r-component and its use in URN resolution
            protocols are a matter for potential standardization in
            separate specifications, presumably including

			resolution service identifiers.</t>
		  <t>Consider the hypothetical
            example of passing parameters to a resolution service (say,
            an ISO alpha-2 country code <xref target='ISO3166-1'/> in
            order to select the preferred country in which to
            search for a physical copy of a book).  This could perhaps

		  If a URN containing an f-component resolves to a single URL

    <section title='URN Equivalence' anchor='equivalence'>
      <section title='Procedure' anchor='equivalence-procedure'>
        <t>For various purposes such as caching, it is often
		   desirable to determine if two URNs are "the same".  This
		   is done most generally (i.e., independent of the scheme) by testing for equivalence (see Section 6.1 of <xref target='RFC3986'/>).</t>
        <t>The generic URI specification <xref target='RFC3986'/> is
		   very flexible about 
		   equality comparisons, putting the focus on allowing false
		   negatives and avoiding false positives.  If comparisons
		   are made in a scheme-independent way, i.e., as URI
		   comparisons only, URNs that this specification considers
		   equal would be rejected.  The discussion below applies
		   when the URIs involved are known to be URNs.</t> 
        <t>Two URNs are equivalent (as URNs) if their &lt;assigned-name&gt; portions are octet-by-octet equal after applying case normalization (as specified in Section 6.2.2.1 of <xref target='RFC3986'/>) to the following constructs:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>the URI scheme "urn", by conversion to lower case</t>
            <t>the NID, by conversion to lower case</t>
            <t>any percent-encoded characters in the NSS (that is, all character triplets that match the &lt;pct-encoding&gt; production found in Section 2.1 of the base URI specification <xref target='RFC3986'/>), by conversion to upper case for the digits A-F.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Percent-encoded characters MUST NOT be decoded, i.e., percent-encoding normalization (as specified in Section 6.2.2.2 of <xref target='RFC3986'/>)
		   MUST NOT be applied as part of the comparison process.</t>
        <t>If a q-component, r-component, or f-component (or any
		   combination thereof) are included in a URN, they MUST be
		   ignored for purposes of determining URN equivalence.</t>
        <t>URN namespace definitions MAY include additional rules for
		   URN equivalence, such as case-insensitivity of the NSS (or parts thereof).  Such rules MUST always have the effect of eliminating some of the false negatives obtained by the procedure above and MUST NOT result in treating two URNs as not equivalent if the procedure here says they are equivalent.  For related considerations with regard to NID registration, see below.</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Examples' anchor='equivalence-examples'>
        <t>This section shows a variety of URNs (using the "example"
		   NID defined in <xref target='RFC6963'/>) that highlight
		   the URN equivalence rules.</t>
        <t>First, because the scheme and NID are case-insensitive, the following URNs are equivalent to each other:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456</t>
            <t>URN:example:a123,z456</t>
            <t>urn:EXAMPLE:a123,z456</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Second, because the q-component and f-component are not
		   taken into account for purposes of testing URN equivalence, the following URNs are equivalent to the first three examples above:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456?=abc</t>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456#789</t>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456#abc</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Third, because the "/" character (and anything that follows
		   it) in the NSS is taken into account for purposes of
		   URN equivalence, the following URNs are not equivalent to each
		   other or to the preceding URNs:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456/foo</t>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456/bar</t>
            <t>urn:example:a123,z456/baz</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Fourth, because of percent-encoding, the following URNs
		   are equivalent only to each other (although %2C is the
		   percent-encoded transformation of "," from the previous
		   examples, such sequences are not decoded for purposes of
		   testing URN equivalence):</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>urn:example:a123%2Cz456</t>
            <t>URN:EXAMPLE:a123%2cz456</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Fifth, because characters other than percent-encoded sequences in the NSS are treated in a case-sensitive manner (unless otherwise specified for the namespace in question), the following URNs are not equivalent to the first three URNs:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>urn:example:A123,z456</t>
            <t>urn:example:a123,Z456</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Sixth, on casual visual inspection of a URN presented in a human-oriented interface the following URN might appear the same as the first three URNs (because U+0430 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A can be confused with U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A), but it is not equivalent:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>urn:example:%D0%B0123,z456</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title='URI Conformance' anchor='conformance'>
      <section title='Use in URI Protocol Slots' anchor='uri-slots'>
        <t>Because a URN is, syntactically, a URI under the "urn" scheme, in theory a URN can be placed in any protocol slot that allows for a URI (e.g., the 'href' and 'src' attributes in HTML, the &lt;base/&gt; element in HTML, the 'xml:base' attribute in XML <xref target='XML-BASE'/>, and the 'xmlns' attribute in XML for XML namespace names <xref target='XML-NAMES'/>).</t>
        <t>However, this does not imply that, semantically, it always makes sense in practice to place a URN in a given URI protocol slot; in particular, because a URN might not specify the location of a resource or even point indirectly to one, it might not be appropriate to place a URN in a URI protocol slot that points to a resource (e.g., the aforementioned 'href' and 'src' attributes).</t>
        <t>Ultimately, guidelines regarding when it is appropriate to use URIs under the "urn" scheme (or any other scheme) are the responsibility of specifications for individual URI protocol slots (e.g., the specification for the 'xml:base' attribute in XML might recommend that it is inappropriate to use URNs in that protocol slot).  This specification cannot possibly anticipate all of the relevant cases, and it is not the place of this specification to require or restrict usage for individual protocol slots.</t>
      </section>
      <section title='Parsing' anchor='uri-parsing'>
        <t>In part because of the separation of URN semantics from
		   more general URI syntax
		   <xref target='I-D.ietf-urnbis-semantics-clarif'/>,
		   generic URI processors need to pay special attention to the parsing and analysis rules of RFC 3986 and, in particular, must treat the URI as opaque unless the scheme and its requirements are recognized.  In the latter case, such processors may be in a position to invoke scheme-appropriate processing such as by a URN resolver.  The URN resolver can either be an external resolver that the URI resolver knows of, or it can be functionality built into the URI resolver.  Note that this requirement might impose constraints on the contexts in which URNs are appropriately used; see <xref target='uri-slots'/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section title='URNs and Relative References' anchor='uri-rr'>
        <t> Section 5.2 of <xref target='RFC3986'/> describes an algorithm for converting a URI reference that might be relative to a given base URI into "parsed components" of the target of that reference, which can then be recomposed per RFC 3986 Section 5.3 into a target URI.   This algorithm cannot be applied directly to URNs because their syntax does not support the necessary path components.  Whenever a URN resolves to a URL which may be used to access the resource, there is a more specific interpretation of q-component and f-component: the q-component is copied verbatim to the query portion of the URL (if that URL scheme supports query), and the f-component is copied verbatim to the fragment portion of the URL.  Even though the notion of a URN as a "persistent", "permanent" identifier does not reconcile easily with relative referencing, resources named with URNs may contain relative references that do not apply to the URN itself.</t>
        <t>Given the foregoing, a relative reference SHOULD NOT be evaluated directly with respect to a URN.   Instead, a relative reference SHOULD be evaluated indirectly with respect to one of the following:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>a base URI (other than a URN) declared by the resource itself; or</t>
            <t>a base URI (other than a URN) obtained through the URN resolution process; or</t>
            <t>the URL of the resource as obtained through the URN resolution process</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>(Case 2 permits the resolution process to explicitly supply a base URI if the resource content is supplied directly by the resolution service rather than via an intermediate "location" URI.)</t>
        <t>If no such base URI exists, use of a relative reference with respect to a URN is an error.  Client behavior in this case is undefined.</t>      
        <t>Resolution services SHOULD ensure that a base URI is supplied any time they provide resource content directly to a client.</t>
      </section>
      <section title='Transport and Display' anchor='uri-display'>
        <t>When URNs are transported and exchanged, they MUST be represented in the format defined herein.  Further, all URN-aware applications MUST offer the option of displaying URNs in this canonical form to allow for direct transcription (for example by cut-and-paste techniques).  Such applications might support display of URNs in a more human-friendly form and might use a character set that includes characters that are not permitted in URN syntax as defined in this specification (e.g., when displaying URNs to humans, such applications might replace percent-encoded strings with characters from an extended character repertoire such as Unicode <xref target='UNICODE'/>).</t>
        <t>To minimize user confusion, a URI browser SHOULD display the complete URN (including the "urn" scheme and any components) to ensure that there is no confusion between URN namespace identifiers and URI scheme identifiers.  For example, a URI beginning with "urn:xmpp:" <xref target='RFC4854'/> is very different from a URI beginning with "xmpp:" <xref target='RFC5122'/>.  Similarly, a potential DOI URI scheme <xref target="DOI-URI"/> is different from, and possibly completely unrelated to, a possible DOI URN namespace.</t>
      </section>
      <section title='URI Design and Ownership' anchor='uri-design'>
        <t>As mentioned, the assignment of URNs is a managed process, as is the assignment of namespaces themselves.  Although design of the URNs to be assigned within a given namespace is ceded by this specification to the namespace owner, doing so in a managed way avoids the problems inherent in unmanaged generation of URIs as described in the recommendations regarding URI design and ownership <xref target='RFC7320'/>.</t>

    <section title='URN Namespaces' anchor='ns'>
      <t>A URN namespace is a collection of identifiers that obey three constraints: each identifier is (1) unique, (2) assigned in a consistent way, and (3) assigned according to a common definition.</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>The "uniqueness" constraint means that an identifier within the namespace is never assigned to more than one resource and never reassigned to a different resource (for the kind of "resource" identified by URNs assigned within the namespace).  This holds true even if the identifier itself is deprecated or becomes obsolete.</t>
          <t>The "consistent assignment" constraint means that an identifier within the namespace is assigned by an organization or created in accordance with a process or algorithm that is always followed.</t>
          <t>The "common definition" constraint means that there are clear definitions for the syntax of identifiers within the namespace and for the process of assigning or creating them.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>A URN namespace is identified by a particular NID in order to ensure the global uniqueness of URNs and, optionally, to provide a cue regarding the structure of URNs assigned within a namespace.</t>
      <t>With regard to global uniqueness, using different NIDs for different collections of identifiers ensures that no two URNs will be the same for different resources, since each collection is required to uniquely assign each identifier.  However, a single resource MAY have more than one URN assigned to it, either in the same namespace (if the namespace permits it) or in different namespaces, and either for similar purposes or different purposes.
		 (For example, if a publisher assigns an ISBN to an
		 electronic publication and that publication is later
		 incorporated into a digital long term archive operated by a
		 national library, the library might assign the publication a
		 NBN, resulting in two URNs referring to the same book.)
		 <!-- Change above per Lars, 20160224 -->
		 Subject to other constraints, such as those imposed by the URI syntax <xref target='RFC3986'/>, the rules of the URN scheme are intended to allow preserving the normal and natural form of identifiers specified  elsewhere when they are treated as URN namespaces.</t>
      <t>With regard to the structure of URNs assigned within a namespace, the development of an identifier structure (and thereby a collection of identifiers) depends on the requirements of the community defining the identifiers, how the identifiers will be assigned and used, etc.  These issues are beyond the scope of URN syntax and the general rules for URN namespaces, because they are specific to the community defining a namespace (e.g., the bibliographic and publishing communities in the case of the 'ISBN' and 'ISSN' namespaces, or the developers of extensions to the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol in the case of the 'XMPP' namespace).</t>
      <t>URN namespaces inherit certain rights and responsibilities by the nature of URNs, e.g.:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>They uphold the general principles of a well-managed URN namespace by providing persistent identification of resources and unique assignment of identifier strings in accordance with a common definition.</t>
          <t>Optionally, they can be registered in global
			 registration services such as those described in <xref target="RFC2483"/>.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>There are two types of URN namespace: formal and informal.  These are distinguished by the expected level of service, the information needed to define the namespace, and the procedures for registration.  Because the majority of the namespaces registered so far have been formal, this document concentrates on formal namespaces.</t>

      <section title='Formal Namespaces' anchor='ns-formal'>
        <t>A formal namespace provides benefit to some subset of
		   users on the Internet.  In particular, it would not make
		   sense for a formal namespace to be used only by a
		   community or network that is not connected to the
		   Internet.  For example, it would be inappropriate for a
		   NID to effectively force someone to use a proprietary
		   network or service not open to the general Internet user.
		   The intent is that, while the community of those who might
		   actively use the URNs assigned within that NID might be
		   small, the potential use of identifiers within that NID is
		   open to any user on the Internet.  Formal NIDs might be
		   appropriate even when some aspects are not fully open.  For
		   example, a namespace might make use of a fee-based,
		   privately managed, or proprietary registry for assignment
		   of URNs in the namespace.  However, it might still benefit
		   some Internet users if the associated services have
		   openly-published identifiers.</t>
        <t>An organization that will assign URNs within a formal namespace SHOULD meet

            <t>Competency in URN assignment.  This will improve the likelihood of persistence (e.g. to minimize the likelihood of conflicts).</t>
            <t>Commitment to not reassigning existing URNs and to allowing old URNs to continue to be valid (e.g., if the assignee of a URN is no longer a member or customer of the assigning organization, if various information about the assignee or named entity happens to change, or even if the assignee or the named entity itself is no longer in existence; in all these cases, the URN is still valid).</t>

      <section title='Informal Namespaces' anchor='ns-informal'>
        <t>Informal namespaces are full-fledged URN namespaces, with all the associated rights and responsibilities.  Informal namespaces differ from formal namespaces in the process for assigning a NID: for an informal namespace, the registrant does not designate the NID; instead, IANA assigns a NID consisting of the string 'urn-' followed by one or more digits (e.g., "urn-7") where the digits consist of the next available number in the sequence of positive integers assigned to informal namespaces.  Thus the syntax of an informal namespace is:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
    InformalNamespaceName = "urn-" Number
    Number                = DigitNonZero 0*Digit
    DigitNonZero          = "1"/ "2" / "3" / "4"/ "5"
                          / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9"
    Digit                 = "0" / DigitNonZero
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>The only restrictions on &lt;Number&gt; are that it (1)
		   consist strictly of ASCII digits, that it (2) not have leading
		   zeros, and that it (3) not cause the NID to exceed the
		   length limitations defined for the URN syntax.</t>

      <section title='Overview' anchor='definition-overview'>
        <t>Because the space of URN namespaces is itself managed, the definition 
           of a namespace SHOULD pay particular attention to:</t>
        <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>The purpose of the namespace.</t>
		  <t>The syntax of URNs assigned within the namespace,
			 including the internal syntax and anticipated effects of
			 q-components or r-components.  (The syntax and interpretation

         <t>Any potential interoperability issues with URNs assigned

		 <t>Optionally, the process for
            resolving URNs issued within the namespace.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>The section on completing the template (<xref target='definition-template'/>) explains these matters in greater detail.  Although the registration templates are the same in all cases, slightly different procedures are used depending on the source of the registration.</t>

      </section>

      <section title='Registration Policy and Process: Community Registrations' anchor='definition-registration-community'>

        <t>The basic registration policy for URN namespaces is Expert
		   Review as defined in the "IANA Considerations" document
		   <xref target='RFC5226'/>.  For namespaces or their
		   definitions that are intended to become standards or
		   normative components of standards, the output of the Expert
		   Review process is intended to be a report, rather than
		   instructions to IANA to take action (see below).
		   The key steps are:</t>   
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>Fill out the namespace registration template (see <xref target='definition-template'/> and <xref target='template'/>).  This can be done as part of an Internet-Draft or a specification in another series, although that is not necessary.</t>
            <t>Send the completed template to the urn@ietf.org discussion list for review.</t>
            <t>If necessary to address comments received, repeat steps 1 and 2.</t>
            <t>If the designated experts approve the request and no
			   standardization action is involved, the IANA will
			   register the requested NID.  If standardization is
			   anticipated, the designated experts will prepare a
			   report and forward it to the appropriate standards
			   approval body (the IESG in the case of the IETF); 
			   IANA will register the requested NID only after
			   receiving directions from that body and a copy of the
			   expert review report.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>A namespace registration can be revised by updating
		   the registration template, following the same steps
		   outlined above for new registrations.  A revised
		   registration MUST describe differences from prior versions
		   and SHOULD make special note of any relevant
		   changes in the underlying technologies or namespace
		   management processes.</t>
        <t>Experience to date with namespace registration requests has shown that 
           registrants sometimes do not initially understand some of the subtleties 
           of URN namespaces, and that defining the namespace in the form of a 
           specification enables the registrants to clearly formulate their "contract" 
           with the intended user community.  Therefore, although the registration 
           policy for formal namespaces is Expert Review and a specification is 
           not strictly required, registrants SHOULD provide a stable 
           specification documenting the namespace definition and expanding upon the
           issues described herein.</t>
        <t>Because naming can be difficult and contentious, namespace registrants and the
           designated experts are strongly encouraged to work together in a spirit of good 
           faith and mutual understanding to achieve rough consensus 
           (see <xref target='RFC7282'/>) on handling registration 
           requests.  They are also encouraged to bring additional expertise into the 
           discussion if that would be helpful in providing perspective or otherwise 
           resolving issues.</t>
		<t>Especially when iterations in the registration process are
		   prolonged, designated experts are expected to take
		   reasonable precautions to avoid "race conditions" on proposed
		   NIDs and, if such situations arise, to encourage
		   applicants to work out any conflicts among themselves.</t>

      <section title='Registration Policy and Process: Fast Track for Standards Development Organizations, Scientific Societies, and Similar Bodies' anchor='definition-registration-fasttrack'>
        <t>The IETF recognizes that situations will arise in which URN namespaces will be created to either
		   embed existing and established standards, particularly identifier standards,
		   or to reflect knowledge, terminology, or methods of organizing information that lie well outside the IETF's scope or the likely subject matter knowledge of its Designated Experts.  In situations in which the registration request originates from, or is authorized by, a recognized standards-related organization, scientific society, or similar body, a somewhat different procedure is available at the option of that body:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>The namespace registration template is filled out and submitted as in steps 1 and 2 above.</t>
            <t>A specification is required that reflects or points to the needed external standards or specifications.  Publication in the RFC Series or through an IETF process (e.g., posting as an Internet Draft) is not expected and would be appropriate only under very unusual circumstances.</t>
            <t>The reviews on the discussion list and by the designated experts are strictly advisory, with the decisions about what advice to accept and the length of time to allocate to the process strictly under the control of the external body.</t>
            <t>When that body concludes that the application is
			   sufficiently mature, its representative(s) will request that IANA complete the registration for the NID, and IANA will do so.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Decisions about whether to recognize the requesting entity as a standards-related organization, scientific society, or similar body are the responsibility of the IESG.</t>
        <t>A model similar to this has already been defined for recognized standards-related organizations that wish to register Media Types.  The document describing that mechanism <xref target='RFC6838'/> provides somewhat more information about the general approach.</t>

            <t>How the intended community (and the Internet community at large) will benefit from using or resolving the assigned URNs.</t>
            <t>How the namespace relates to and complements existing URN namespaces, URI schemes, and identifier systems.</t>
            <t>The kinds of software applications that can use or resolve the assigned URNs (e.g., by differentiating among disparate namespaces, identifying resources in a persistent fashion, or meaningfully resolving and accessing services associated with the namespace).</t>
            <t>Whether resolution services are available or will be available (and, if so, the nature or identity of the services).
			   Examples of q-component and, when they are standardized, r-component,

      </section>

      <section title='Syntax' anchor='definition-syntax'>
        <t>The "Syntax" section of the template contains:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>A description of the structure of URNs within the namespace, in conformance with the fundamental URN syntax.  The structure might be described in terms of a formal definition (e.g., using Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications (ABNF) as specified in <xref target='RFC5234'/>), an algorithm for generating conformant URNs, or a regular expression for parsing the identifier into components; alternatively, the structure might be opaque.</t>
            <t>Any special character encoding rules for assigned URNs
			   (e.g., which character ought to always be used for
			   quotes).</t>
            <t>Rules for determining URN equivalence between two
			   identifiers in the namespace.  Such rules ought to
			   always have the effect of eliminating false negatives
			   that might otherwise result from comparison.  If it is
			   appropriate and helpful, reference can be made to
			   specific equivalence rules defined in the URI
			   specification <xref target='RFC3986'/>.
			   <!-- See Tracker, "2141bis: Equivalence rules #8" -->
			   Examples of URN equivalence rules include equivalence between
			   uppercase and lowercase characters in the Namespace
			   Specific String, between hyphenated and non-hyphenated
			   groupings in the identifier string, or between
			   single-quotes and double-quotes.
			   There may also be namespace-specific special encoding
			   considerations, especially for URNs that contain
			   embedded forms of other types of identifiers. 
			   <!-- Added per JcK to Keith message 2015-03-31 on "% encoding
			   issues" -->
			   (Note that these are
			   not normative statements for any kind of best practice
			   related to handling of relationships between characters
			   in general; such statements are limited to one particular namespace only.)</t>
            <t>Any special considerations necessary for conforming with
			   the URN syntax.  This is particularly applicable in the
			   case of existing naming systems that are used in the context of URNs.  For example, if a namespace is used in contexts other than URNs, it might make use of characters that are reserved in the URN syntax.  This section ought to note any such characters, and outline necessary mappings to conform to URN syntax.  Normally, this will be handled by percent-encoding the character as specified in Section 2.1 of the URI specification <xref target='RFC3986'/>.</t>
            <t>Any special considerations for the meaning of q-components (e.g., keywords) or f-components (e.g., predefined terms) in the context of this namespace.</t>

        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>Mechanisms or authorities for assigning URNs to
			   resources.  It ought to make clear whether assignment
			   is completely open (e.g., following a particular
			   procedure such as first-come, first-served (FCFS)),
			   completely closed (e.g., for a private 
			   organization), or limited in various ways (e.g.,
			   delegated to authorities recognized by a particular
			   organization); if limited, it ought to explain how to
			   become an assigner of identifiers or how to request
			   assignment of identifiers from existing assignment authorities.</t>
            <t>Methods for ensuring that URNs within the namespace are unique.  For example, identifiers might be assigned sequentially or in accordance with some well-defined process by a single authority, assignment might be partitioned among delegated authorities that are individually responsible for respecting uniqueness rules, or URNs might be created independently following an algorithm that itself guarantees uniqueness.</t>

          percent-encoding of certain characters) or scope (e.g., overlapping
          areas of interest).  If at all possible, concerns that

           addition, if the assigning organization intends to implement registration 
           for publicly advertised resolution services (for example using a system 
           based on principles similar to those described in <xref target='RFC2276'/>
           and <xref target='RFC2483'/>), then this section SHOULD 
           list or reference the requirements for being publicly advertised by the

<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

<abstract>
<t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).&lt;/t>&lt;t> In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract><t>Experience has shown that identifiers associated with persistent names have properties and requirements that may be somewhat different from identifiers associated with the locations of objects.  This is especially true when such names are expected to be stable for a very long time or when they identify large and complex entities.  In order to allow Uniform Resource Names (URNs) to evolve to meet the needs of the Library, Museum, Publisher, and Informational Sciences communities and other users, this specification separates URNs from the semantic constraints that many people believe are part of the specification for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) specified in RFC 3986, updating that document accordingly.  The syntax of URNs is still constrained to that of RFC 3986, so generic URI parsers are unaffected by this change.</t></abstract>

   This document addresses the issues of the discovery of URN (Uniform
   Resource Name) resolver services that in turn will directly translate
   URNs into URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and URCs (Uniform Resource
   Characteristics).  The document falls into three major parts, the
   assumptions underlying the work, the guidelines in order to be a
   viable Resolver Discovery Service or RDS, and a framework for
   designing RDSs.  The guidelines fall into three principle areas:
   evolvability, usability, and security and privacy.  An RDS that is
   compliant with the framework will not necessarily be compliant with
   the guidelines.  Compliance with the guidelines will need to be
   validated separately.

<abstract>
<t>
   Retrieving the resource identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI)  is only one of the operations that can be performed on a
   URI.  One might also ask for and get a list of other identifiers that
   are aliases for the original URI or a bibliographic description of
   the resource the URI denotes, for example. This applies to both
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
   Uniform Resource Characteristics (URCs) are discussed in this
   document but only as descriptions of resources rather than
   identifiers.
</t>
<t>
   A service in the network providing access to a resource may provide
   one or some of these options, but it need not provide all of them.
   This memo specifies an initial set of these operations that can be
   used to describe the interactions provided by a given access service.
   It also suggests guidelines that should be adhered to when those
   operations are encoded in a protocol.

<abstract>
<t>Identifiers such as hostnames, URIs, IP addresses, and email addresses are often used in security contexts to identify security principals and resources.  In such contexts, an identifier presented via some protocol is often compared using some policy to make security decisions such as whether the security principal may access the resource, what level of authentication or encryption is required, etc.  If the parties involved in a security decision use different algorithms to compare identifiers, then failure scenarios ranging from denial of service to elevation of privilege can result.  This document provides a discussion of these issues that designers should consider when defining identifiers and protocols, and when constructing architectures that use multiple protocols.</t></abstract></front>

<t>The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work through a consensus process, taking into account the different views among IETF participants and coming to (at least rough) consensus on technical matters. In particular, the IETF is supposed not to be run by a "majority rule" philosophy. This is why we engage in rituals like "humming" instead of voting. However, more and more of our actions are now indistinguishable from voting, and quite often we are letting the majority win the day without consideration of minority concerns. This document explains some features of rough consensus, what is not rough consensus, how we have gotten away from it, how we might think about it differently, and the things we can do in order to really achieve rough consensus.&lt;/t>&lt;t> Note: This document is quite consciously being put forward as Informational. It does not propose to change any IETF processes and is therefore not a BCP. It is simply a collection of principles, hopefully around which the IETF can come to (at least rough) consensus.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>Section 1.1.1 of RFC 3986 defines URI syntax as "a federated and extensible naming system wherein each scheme's specification may further restrict the syntax and semantics of identifiers using that scheme." In other words, the structure of a URI is defined by its scheme.  While it is common for schemes to further delegate their substructure to the URI's owner, publishing independent standards that mandate particular forms of URI substructure is inappropriate, because that essentially usurps ownership.  This document further describes this problematic practice and provides some acceptable alternatives for use in standards.</t></abstract></front>

    <section title='Changes from RFC 2141' anchor='changes-2141'>	   
      <t>This document makes substantive changes from the syntax
		 and semantics of <xref target='RFC2141'/>:</t>
	  <section title="Syntax changes from RFC 2141">
      <t>The syntax of URNs as provided in <xref target='RFC2141'/> was defined before the updated specification of URIs in <xref target='RFC3986'/>.  The definition of URN syntax is updated in this document to do the following:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Ensure consistency with the URI syntax.</t>
          <t>Facilitate the use of URNs with parameters similar to URI queries and fragments.</t>
          <t>Permit parameters influencing URN resolution.</t>
          <t>Ease the use of URNs with naming systems that include the '/' character.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>In particular, this specification does the following:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Extends URN syntax to explicitly allow the characters
			 '/', "?", and "#", which were reserved for future use by
			 RFC 2141.  As described below,
			 this change effectively also allows several components
			 of the URI syntax although without necessarily tying
			 those components to URI semantics.</t> 
          <t>Defines general syntax for an additional component that
			 can be used in interactions with a URN resolution service.</t>
          <t>Disallows "-" at the end of a NID.</t>
          <t>Allows the "/", "~", and "&amp;" characters in the namespace-specific string (NSS).</t>
          <t>Makes several smaller syntax adjustments.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
	  </section>
	  <section title="Other changes from RFC 2141">	 
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Formally registers 'urn' as a URI scheme.</t>
          <t>Allows what are now called q-components, r-components, and f-components.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>In addition, some of the text has been updated to be
		 consistent with the definition of Uniform Resource
		 Identifiers (URIs) <xref target='RFC3986'/> and the
		 processes for registering information with the IANA
		 <xref target='RFC5226'/>, as well as more modern guidance

    <section title='Changes from RFC 3406' anchor='changes-3406'>
      <t>This document makes the following substantive changes from <xref target='RFC3406'/>:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Relaxes the registration policy for formal namespaces
			 from "IETF Review" to "Expert Review" as discussed in
			 <xref target='definition-registration-community'/>.</t>
          <t>Removes the category of experimental namespaces,
			 consistent with <xref target='RFC6648'/>.  Experimental
			 namespaces were denoted by prefixing the namespace
			 identifier with the string "X-". Because experimental
			 namespaces were never registered, removing the
			 experimental category has no impact on the existing
			 registries.  Because they are not registered, strings
			 that refer to experimental namespaces are not valid
			 URNs.  Truly experimental usages MAY, of course, employ
			 the 'example' namespace <xref target='RFC6963'/>.</t>
          <t>Adds some information too, but generally simplifies, the
			 registration template.</t>
